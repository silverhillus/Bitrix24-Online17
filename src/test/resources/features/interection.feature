Feature: User interact with employees on the posts

  Agile story 10. As a user, I should be able to interact with employees on the posts that I have access to.

  Scenario:  Users should be able to make a comment, like,
  or unfollow on other employees' posts.

    Given  User is on the  CRM 24 home page
    Then user should be able to make a coment
    And user should be able to like other employees posts
    And user should be able to unfollow on other employees' posts
